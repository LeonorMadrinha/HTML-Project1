<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Maria Leonor, a 30-year-old from Portugal currently living in the beautiful city of Vienna, Austria. 
  I love exploring nature, and you can often find me wandering through green spaces or taking peaceful strolls in the countryside.
</p>

<p>  In my free time, I enjoy playing computer games and binge-watching my favorite series.
  I am especially passionate about animations, with Disney’s Pocahontas being my all-time favorite.
  This movie captivated me by its stunning graphics, enchanting landscapes, and unforgettable music.
</p>

<p>I currently work in the restaurant industry, but my dream is to transition into programming.
  I am drawn to the challenges of logic and problem-solving, and I look forward to the sense of achievement
  that comes with overcoming each new hurdle.
</p>

<p> My journey is all about exploration, whether it's in nature, gaming, or coding. I’m excited to see where it leads me next! </p>
